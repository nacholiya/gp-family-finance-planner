# Implementation Plans Archive

This directory contains accepted implementation plans, saved before work begins. Plans are version-controlled historical records that document **what** was planned and **why**, providing context for future improvements.

## Naming Convention

```
YYYY-MM-DD-<short-slug>.md
```

Examples:

- `2026-02-22-currency-chips-and-language-picker.md`
- `2026-02-25-virtual-scrolling-transactions.md`

## File Format

```markdown
# Plan: <Title>

> Date: YYYY-MM-DD
> Related issues: #<number>, #<number>

## Context

<Why this work is needed>

## Approach

<The accepted implementation plan>

## Files affected

<List of files to be created or modified>
```

## Workflow

1. Enter plan mode and design the approach
2. User approves the plan
3. Save the plan to this directory **before** writing any code
4. Implement the plan
5. The plan file stays permanently — never delete plans
