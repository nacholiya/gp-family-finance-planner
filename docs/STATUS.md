- Family member management (global member filter)
- Settings page (currency, theme, sync, encryption)
- First-run setup wizard
- Multi-currency display with global display currency selector

### Beanie Brand Asset Icons

- `beanies_covering_eyes_transparent_512x512.png` — replaces all lock/closed-padlock SVG icons (privacy mode active, data encrypted, data hidden)
- `beanies_open_eyes_transparent_512x512.png` — replaces all open-padlock SVG icons (privacy mode off, data visible, data unencrypted)
- `beanies_impact_bullet_transparent_192x192.png` — replaces warning/alert/exclamation SVG icons and all feature bullet point icons (SyncStatusIndicator warning, PasskeySettings alert, LoginPage security bullets, SetupPage security bullets)
- Theme skill (`.claude/skills/beanies-theme.md`) updated with icon usage guide

### Centralized Icon System (Issue #44)

- **`src/constants/icons.ts`** — Central registry of ~72 beanie-styled SVG icon definitions with `BeanieIconDef` type. Organized into: NAV (9), ACTION (8), SUMMARY (5), UTILITY (10), STATUS (4), CATEGORY (28), ACCOUNT_TYPE (8), ASSET_TYPE (9). Helper functions: `getIconDef()`, `getAccountTypeIcon()`, `getAssetTypeIcon()`
- **`src/components/ui/BeanieIcon.vue`** — Universal icon component enforcing brand style (stroke-width 1.75, round linecap/linejoin). Props: `name`, `size` (xs/sm/md/lg/xl), `strokeWidth`. Falls back to three-dot circle for unknown icons
- **`src/components/common/PageHeader.vue`** — Shared page header with 40px rounded-xl icon container + title + subtitle + action slot
- **15 files migrated** — All inline SVGs replaced with BeanieIcon in: AppSidebar, AppHeader, BaseModal, CategoryIcon, AccountTypeIcon, DashboardPage, AccountsPage, TransactionsPage, AssetsPage, GoalsPage, ReportsPage, ForecastPage, FamilyPage, SettingsPage
- CategoryIcon.vue reduced from ~365 lines to ~45 lines (19-branch v-if chain → single BeanieIcon)
- AccountsPage reduced from 893 to ~591 lines; AssetsPage collapsed 2x 9-branch asset type icon chains
- Zero inline `<svg>` elements remaining in all migrated files

### Micro-Animations (Issue #45)

- Page header icon bounce on load, sidebar hover wobble/scale, card hover lift
- Summary card count-up animation, goal progress bar fill animation
- Empty state floating/breathing animation
- Privacy toggle beanie blink, theme toggle rotation
- All animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- CSS `@keyframes` using hardware-accelerated `transform` + `opacity`

### Empty State Beanie Illustrations (Issue #47)

- Beanie character illustrations for all empty states: accounts, transactions, recurring, assets, goals, reports, dashboard
- `EmptyStateIllustration.vue` component with variant prop
- Stored in `public/brand/empty-states/`

### 404 Page Redesign (Issue #48)

- Full beanie-themed 404 page with lost beanie illustration
- Playful heading and encouraging subtext, brand-styled CTA

### Loading States with Brand Spinner (Issue #49)

- `BeanieSpinner.vue` component using `beanies_spinner_transparent_192x192.png`
- Brand spinner for all loading states (app load, language switching, data fetch, button loading)
- Loading text: "counting beans..." (never "Loading...")

### Forecast "Coming Soon" Redesign (Issue #50)

- Beanie with telescope illustration
- Warm brand-voice copy, beanie impact bullet icons for feature list

### Sound Effects System (Issue #46)

- **`src/composables/useSounds.ts`** — Web Audio API synthesised sounds (zero bundle size, sub-ms latency)
- 6 sound functions: `playPop()`, `playClink()`, `playChime()`, `playFanfare()`, `playWhoosh()`, `playBlink()`
- `soundEnabled` global setting (defaults to `true`) with toggle in Settings > General
- AudioContext created lazily on first user gesture (browser autoplay compliance)
- Celebration integration: `playChime()` on toast celebrations, `playFanfare()` on modal celebrations
- Delete actions: `playWhoosh()` on account/transaction/recurring/asset/goal deletes
- Privacy toggle: `playBlink()` on header privacy eye toggle
- App.vue watcher syncs `soundEnabled` setting to composable
- Goal completion detection fixed: `updateGoal()` now detects completion transitions and fires celebrations (previously only `updateProgress()` did, which was never called from UI)
- Goals empty state fixed: shows when all goals are completed (was checking all goals instead of active goals)
- Celebration toast image enlarged from 40px to 80px
- Unit tests (5) and E2E tests (3)

### Multi-Family Architecture (Stage 1)

- Per-family database architecture: each family gets its own IndexedDB (`gp-family-finance-{familyId}`)
- Registry database (`gp-finance-registry`): stores families, user mappings, cached auth sessions, global settings
- Family context orchestrator (`familyContext.ts`) and Pinia store (`familyContextStore.ts`)
- Legacy migration service: auto-migrates single-DB data to per-family DB on first boot
- Global settings split from per-family settings (theme, language, exchange rates are device-level)
- Sync file format v2.0: includes `familyId` and `familyName` (backward-compatible with v1.0)
- Per-family file handle storage for sync
- New types: `Family`, `UserFamilyMapping`, `CachedAuthSession`, `GlobalSettings`
- All existing repositories work unchanged (transparent multi-tenancy via `getDatabase()`)
- E2E test helpers updated for dynamic per-family DB discovery

### Auth Service + AWS Cognito SDK (Stage 2)

- Installed `amazon-cognito-identity-js` browser SDK
- Cognito config reader (`src/config/cognito.ts`): reads User Pool ID, Client ID, Region from env vars
- Cognito service (`src/services/auth/cognitoService.ts`): signUp, signIn, signOut, session management, custom auth (magic link prep)
- Token manager (`src/services/auth/tokenManager.ts`): caches JWT tokens in registry DB, 7-day offline grace period
- Auth is fully optional — disabled when Cognito env vars are not set

### Login Page + Route Guards + Session Management (Stage 3)

- Auth store (`src/stores/authStore.ts`): initializeAuth, signIn, signUp, signOut, continueWithoutAuth
- Login page (`src/pages/LoginPage.vue`): Sign In / Create Account tabs, "Continue without account" option
- Magic link callback page placeholder (`src/pages/MagicLinkCallbackPage.vue`)
- Route guards: all app routes have `requiresAuth: true`, login/magic-link routes exempt
- App.vue bootstrap: global settings → auth init → family resolution → data load
- AppHeader: profile dropdown with family name, email, sign out, offline badge
- ADR-009 (per-family database architecture) and ADR-010 (AWS Cognito authentication)

### Family Management Enhancements (Stage 4)

- Role management: `MemberRoleManager.vue` dropdown to promote/demote members (admin/member)
- `updateMemberRole()` action in familyStore
- Family name editing inline in FamilyPage header
- `CreateMemberAccountModal.vue` placeholder (requires Lambda backend)
- "Create Login" button on member cards (shown when auth is configured)

### Magic Link Authentication (Stage 5)

- `MagicLinkCallbackPage.vue` completes custom auth challenge: initiates custom auth → responds with code → caches tokens → redirects to dashboard
- LoginPage "Sign in with magic link" option: email input → "Check your email" confirmation screen
- `initiateCustomAuth()` and `respondToMagicLinkChallenge()` in cognitoService (implemented in Stage 2)
- Requires AWS Lambda infrastructure for challenge generation (Define/Create/Verify Auth Challenge Lambdas + DynamoDB + SES)

### Passkey (WebAuthn) Authentication (Stage 6)

- `passkeyService.ts`: feature detection, registration, sign-in, passkey management (localStorage for MVP)
- `PasskeySettings.vue` component: lists registered passkeys, register new, remove existing
- LoginPage "Sign in with passkey" button (shown when WebAuthn is supported)
- SettingsPage Security section with PasskeySettings (shown when auth is configured)
- Requires Cognito WebAuthn support + server-side challenge generation for full flow

### File-First Architecture

- Encrypted data file is the source of truth; IndexedDB is a temporary cache deleted on sign-out
- Sign-out cleanup: `deleteFamilyDatabase()`, `resetState()` on all data stores, file handle preserved
- App startup always loads from data file when configured; IndexedDB fallback only when file permission not yet granted
- Auto-sync always on when file is configured (no toggle)
- Setup wizard adds Step 3 "Secure Your Data": requires file creation with encryption password
- Default `encryptionEnabled` changed to `true`
- Settings renamed "File Sync" → "Family Data Options"; removed Sync Now, Disconnect, Auto-sync toggle
- Encryption toggle warns before disabling
- SyncStatusIndicator: "Syncing..." → "Saving...", "Synced to..." → "Data saved to..."
- Login page: three security benefit bullet points (encrypted file, no server storage, cloud backup via folder)
- ADR-011: file-first architecture decision record

### beanies.family Rebranding (Issue #22)

- Renamed app from "GP Family Planner" to `beanies.family` across all UI, metadata, and configuration
- Updated `index.html` title and Google Fonts (Outfit + Inter replacing Poppins)
- Updated `vite.config.ts` PWA manifest: name, short_name, description, theme_color, background_color
- Updated `package.json` name, `router/index.ts` title, `passkeyService.ts` RP_NAME, `uiStrings.ts` app name/tagline
- Rewrote `src/style.css` with Tailwind 4 `@theme` brand colour scales (Heritage Orange, Deep Slate, Sky Silk, Terracotta)
- Replaced `public/favicon.svg` with beanies-branded SVG
- Updated all UI components to squircle shape language (`rounded-2xl`/`rounded-3xl`/`rounded-xl`)
- Replaced all blue/indigo colours with brand primaries (`primary-500` Heritage Orange, `secondary-500` Deep Slate)
- Updated AppSidebar: beanies logo, brand wordmark, Outfit font, primary active states
- Updated AppHeader: primary colours for active states and privacy toggle
- Updated all 12 page files: brand colours, brand name, brand backgrounds
- Added `CelebrationOverlay.vue` component with toast (4s auto-dismiss) and modal modes
- Added `useCelebration` composable with six celebration triggers wired to key app events:
  - Setup complete, first file save, first account, first transaction, goal reached, debt paid off
- Added pod spinner loading overlay in `App.vue` ("counting beans..." copy)
- Added project-local skill `.claude/skills/beanies-theme.md`

### Recent Fixes

- **Multi-family isolation hardening** — Fixed cross-family data leakage when authenticated user's familyId could not be resolved:
  - Added cached session familyId as 4th fallback in auth resolution chain (JWT → getUserAttributes → registry → cached session)
  - Authenticated users no longer fall back to `lastActiveFamilyId` (which could belong to a different user)
  - Placeholder family creation now uses auth-resolved ID instead of random UUID (`createFamilyWithId()`)
  - Sync service refuses to load sync file whose `familyId` doesn't match the active family (in `loadAndImport`, `openAndLoadFile`, `decryptAndImport`)
  - Sync service skips initialization when no active family is set (prevents legacy key fallback)
  - Sync service `reset()` clears stale file handles and session passwords on family switch
  - Sync service tracks `currentFileHandleFamilyId` — `save()` blocks writes if handle belongs to a different family
  - Added `closeDatabase()` before loading family data to ensure clean DB connection
  - 22 multi-family isolation tests (up from 19)
- Restored ReportsPage that was wiped during bulk ESLint/Prettier formatting
- Added data-testid attributes to transaction items and account cards for E2E tests
- Fixed E2E tests to switch to transactions tab before interacting with elements
- Switched from idb library to native IndexedDB APIs

## In Progress

- **Multi-Family with AWS Cognito Auth** — All 6 stages implemented (client-side); awaiting AWS infrastructure deployment for magic link + passkey backend

### Completed Goals Section (Issue #55)

- Collapsible "Completed Goals" disclosure section below active goals list (collapsed by default)
- Completed goals sorted by most recently completed, showing name, type, member, completion date, and final amounts
- Reopen button moves a goal back to the active list; delete button removes with whoosh sound
- Muted styling distinguishes completed from active goals; privacy mode blur on amounts
- Renamed "All Goals" card to "Active Goals" for clarity
- 3 new translation keys with beanie mode overrides (`goals.reopenGoal`, `goals.noCompletedGoals`, `goals.completedOn`)
